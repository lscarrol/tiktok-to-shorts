news had a lot to say about the trump indictment so if you don't watch fox

1
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:08,031
news here are five totally real and definitely not desperate legal theories you might have missed

2
00:00:08,064 --> 00:00:12,831
this week so it's a crime to follow legal advice now they're charging him with the

3
00:00:12,928 --> 00:00:20,447
crime of taking bad legal advice trump was seeking legal advice essentially criminalised bad legal advice

4
00:00:20,704 --> 00:00:26,208
it turns out if the advice you're following is commit crime yeah that's a crime never

5
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:30,431
feels like they have the best lawyers I don't get how you can try Donald trump

6
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,639
for defrauding the united states when all he did was simply defraud the united states it's

7
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:42,527
a crime to ask pence not to certify bro listen to yourself for like one second

8
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:46,880
I wonder if pence would agree that that was a crime there is still good reason

9
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:52,223
to believe twenty twenty was stolen okay he still believes the election was stolen and he

10
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:55,967
has good cause to believe self damn that's crazy you should bring that evidence to a

11
00:00:56,096 --> 00:01:00,032
trumpet pointing judge and see what they say this trial is rigged they're going to make

12
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:05,183
us bring evidence and proof that the election was stolen are we going to now have

13
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:09,856
to go back and find fraud in the twenty twenty election is this now what we're

14
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:13,823
going to go relitigate what have you guys been doing for the last three years this

15
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:20,192
is the criminalization of disinformation this is criminalizing thought how are you going to prove that

16
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:25,375
Donald trump didn't believe the election lies he was viewing so I don't understand how you

17
00:01:25,472 --> 00:01:30,208
can actually prove this or read his mind just spitballing here probably the same way they

18
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:34,463
proved you didn't believe the election lies you were spewing I'll see you on Friday for

19
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:39,008
next week's recap because as we can all see fox never learns its lesson even when

20
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:40,863
it costs a hundred million dollars
