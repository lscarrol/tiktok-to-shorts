Fox News had a lot to say about the Trump indictment so if you don't watch Fox News here are five totally real and definitely not desperate legal theories you might have missed this week so it's a crime to follow legal advice now they're charging him with the crime of taking bad legal advice Trump was seeking legal advice essentially criminalize bad legal advice it turns out if the advice you're following is commit crime never feels like they have the best lawyers I don't get how you can try Donald Trump for defrauding the United States when all he did was simply defraud the United States and proof that the election fraud in the 2020 election is this now what we're going to go really good what have you guys been doing for the last three years this is the criminalization of information this is criminalizing thought how are you going to prove that Donald Trump didn't believe the election lies he was feeling so I don't understand how you can actually prove this or read his mind just stopping here probably the same way they proved you didn't believe the election lies you were feeling I'll see you on Friday for next week's recap because we can all see thoughts Neverland even when it costs $800 million dollars
